## Hello, I'm Graham 👋

I’m a Software Developer at Fidelity Investments with a passion for coding. Currently working on some personal projects in my spare time, and some open source projects also. I enjoy working with a variety of programming languages and tools to create efficient, scalable solutions. If you're interested in software development or want to speak with me, feel free to reach out via email!
